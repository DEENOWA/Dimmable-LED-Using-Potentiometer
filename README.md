# Dimmable-LED-Using-Potentiometer
This Arduino sketch controls the brightness of an LED connected to PWM pin 10 using a potentiometer on analog pin A2. It displays the potentiometer value and calculated output on the Serial Monitor. The sketch is designed for an Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) to demonstrate analog input, PWM output, and serial communication.
